# Deep Dive into Collections

Scala collections are distinguised between mutable and immutable collections 

* A **Mutable collection** can be updated or extended in place,Which means you can add,remove or delete elements in place.

* **Immutable collection** cannot be updated or extended in place. However you can still perform add,remove or delete
operations on the orgiginal container, but that will result in a new container leaving the original container unchanged.

* Immutable collections are found in the package **scala.collection.immutable** and mutable collections 
are found in the package **scala.collection.mutable**
